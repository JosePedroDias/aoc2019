# Advent of Code 2019

This time I will try to make it till the end, hopefully learning a bit about rust as well.  
Very newbie code ahead, be advised.

## setup stuff

Using visual studio code for development in linux and osx.

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and `rustup update`
- extensions
  - Rust (rls)
  - CodeLLDB

## run it

To calculate the answers do:

    cargo run --release

To run the tests for each day do:

    cargo test
